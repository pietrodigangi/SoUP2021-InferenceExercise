- for python/Jupyter experts: `Inference-pro.ipynb` 
Open, edit and run the notebook depending on your experience with python and/or Jupyter notebooks.

### Ancillary input files
- Signal S1 spectrum: `Sig-WIMP-50-S1.txt`
- ER background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-ER-S1.txt`
- NR background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-NR-S1.txt`
- An example dataset you can work with: `example_dataset_0.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)
- Test statistic distributions under signal hypotheses: `test_stat_distributions.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)
