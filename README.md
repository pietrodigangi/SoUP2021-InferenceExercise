# SoUP2021-InferenceExercise
Exercise on statistical inference for a dark matter search experiment for the [SoUP 20|21 INFN School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/871645/)

## Exercise Jupyter notebook: 
- The exercise is given in this notebook: `Inference.ipynb` 
- A guided version of the exercise is also available: `Inference-beginners.ipynb`

If you are a python beginner or you prefer a simplified/guided version, use `Inference-beginners.ipynb`

### How to run the exercise
Download this repository on your machine (go to Code button), run Jupyter and open one of the exercise notebooks.

### Ancillary input files
- Signal S1 spectrum: `Sig-WIMP-50-S1.txt`
- ER background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-ER-S1.txt`
- NR background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-NR-S1.txt`
- An example dataset you can work with: `example_dataset_0.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)
- Test statistic distributions under signal hypotheses: `test_statistic_distributions.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)
