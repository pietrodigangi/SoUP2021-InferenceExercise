# SoUP2021-InferenceExercise
Exercise on statistical inference for a dark matter search experiment for the [SoUP 20|21 INFN School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/871645/)

## Exercise Jupyter notebook: 
It is available in two versions
- for python/Jupyter beginners: `Inference-beginners.ipynb`
- for python/Jupyter experts: `Inference-pro.ipynb` 

Open, edit and run the notebook which fits best your experience with python and/or Jupyter notebooks.

### Ancillary input files
- Signal S1 spectrum: `Sig-WIMP-50-S1.txt`
- ER background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-ER-S1.txt`
- NR background S1 spectrum: `Bkg-NR-S1.txt`
- An example dataset you can work with: `example_dataset_0.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)
- Test statistic distributions under signal hypotheses: `test_statistic_distributions.pkl` (this is a pickle file containing a Pandas dataframe)

## Exercise solution:
You can find a complete version of the notebook, where the excercise is fully solved, in the subdirectory: `solution`
